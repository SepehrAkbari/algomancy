# Algomancy

This repository is a personal collection of algorithmic challenges and problems that I solve for fun and learning. It serves as a way to practice problem-solving, explore new algorithms, and document my solutions. I call this algorithmic therapy...

## Contents

Every problem is categorized into one of the following folders.

- [Arrays](./arrays/): linear data collections and basic manipulations.
- [Structures](./structures/): non-linear data structures and organizations.
- [Recursion](./recursion/): recursive and dynamic programming.
- [Greedy](./greedy/): local optimization and heuristic approaches.
- [Search](./search/): state-space exploration and pathfinding.
- [Math](./math/): all things mathematical.

Some problems are placed inside subfolders ending with `_gpu` which are GPU-accelerated implementations. Other subfolders simply mean different variations of the same problem.

## Languages

I try to challenge myself by solving in different languages, especially the ones I don't use often.
